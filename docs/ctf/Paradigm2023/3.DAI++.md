# Desription
MakerDAO is such a complex codebase, and we all know that larger codebases are more likely to have bugs. I simplified everything, so there shouldnâ€™t be any bugs here

# Code
`Account.sol`:
- deposit():
- withdraw():
- increaseDebt():
- decreaseDebt():
- isHealthy():
- recoverAccount():

`AccountManager.sol`
- onlyValidAccount()
- migrateAccount()
- _openAccount()
- mintStablecoins()
- burnStablecoins()

`Challenge.sol`

`StableCoin.sol`:
- Just ERC20 Token from system_configuration

`SystemConfiguration.sol`
