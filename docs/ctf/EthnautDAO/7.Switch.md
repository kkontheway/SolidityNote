# Description
For this challenge, we have to deal only with a single Smart Contract called Switch. The goal of the challenge is to gain ownership of the contract, overriding the value of the owner state variable.

/**

 */
contract Switch {
    address public owner;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Changes the ownership of the contract. Can only be called by the owner
    function changeOwnership(address _owner) public onlyOwner {
        owner = _owner;
    }

    // Allows the owner to delegate the change of ownership to a different address by providing the owner's signature
    function changeOwnership(
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) public {
        require(ecrecover(generateHash(owner), v, r, s) != address(0), "signer is not the owner");
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Generates a hash compatible with EIP-191 signatures
    function generateHash(address _addr) private pure returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32 addressHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_addr));
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32", addressHash));
    }
}
```

# Solution

我们可以看到在changeOwnership中只验证了VRS的有效性，但是没有认证ecrecover出来的地址是否是owner就直接切换了，所以我们随便传入一个签名都可以做到。
```
uint256 privateKey = 123456;
bytes32 hashedMessage = bytes32(0);

// sign the hashed message
(uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(privateKey, hashedMessage);
```
